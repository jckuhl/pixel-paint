# pixel-paint

Pixel Paint is a simple project made with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  Create a grid from 1 to 30 rows (that's 1 to 900 pixels!), pick a color, and start drawing!  Just click on a pixel to paint it!  Don't like what you see?  Clear will erase everything and reset will let you create a new board.
